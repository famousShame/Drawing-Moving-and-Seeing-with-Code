Michael Whitelaw describes emergence as “…the process by which complex systems seem to acquire new properties from one level of scale to the next” and “How the complex interactions of inert matter at the micro-level give rise to life at the macro-level”.
After reading the introduction to Metacreation by Michael Whitelaw, I thought of a project described to me by one of my former professors, Jakub Ciupinski. I was not able to find this project online. Hopefully I am able to describe it accurately.


The project was a program that would perform guitar melodies using physical modeling algorithms and artificial intelligence to come up with the melodies. It was extremely realistic and even had minor details such as the sounds of fingers on the fretboard and ambient sound to make it seem like a real audio recording. The part that reminded me of artificial life was the way that the program would decide on the melodies. The program was given hundreds of melodies, some of which were melodic, and some of which were not. A genetic reproduction algorithm was used to combine the melodies and create offspring. This was so that the melodies sounded more realistic and less boring. What happened though was that the melodies would eventually converge into the same melody, because two melodies that were too close to being the same, would always reproduce together. Mutations were introduced to the program to prevent the convergence. So when two melodies that were too similar tried to reproduce, the offspring would have to have some mutations to keep all of the melodies from converging into the same one. I know this is a rough description, but I am describing it from memory. 


I also checked out some more typical A-life programs such as Species, Creature, ScriptBot, and a few others. I found that it is difficult to observe anything interesting unless watching the programs for a very long time. In Species, it is possible for the player to control the organisms in certain ways, which I feel was not as autonomous as other examples I have seen.


When working with P5.js this week, I made a model of mosquitos swarming around a drop of blood. I tried to make their movements more “swarm-like” by making the magnitude and acceleration higher. I varied the size of the mosquitos to try and simulate some of them already having drank some blood. At first I was trying to simulate mice going after a piece of cheese, but I couldn’t seem to get the smaller spurts of movement that are typical of mice. When I began working with the mosquitos, I found that if I held the mouse in one place they would all just stack up, which didn’t seem realistic. Eventually by messing around with the top speed, acceleration and magnitude, I was able to get some movement that I thought looked more like a swarm.
