## Squirrel Game

For the squirrel eat squirrel game, we decided to use pixel art, and give it an arcade game lava level feel. The most difficult parts were getting the collisions to work and figuring out how to have things trigger once instead of repeatedly one the conditions were met. Another issue we ran into is, we tried going about it in a very “fundamentals” type of way, like using global variables and not using vectors. This gave us a lot of issue further in the process so we had to change everything to use class constructors and vectors. The final version looks very much like an arcade game with bit crushed music and classic sound effects.
