Working with Hydra has been an amazing experience. I definitely think that the language is intuitive for people who are familiar with synthesizers or other input/output interfaces. I work with audio synthesizers, both hardware and software synthesizers and I have some experience coding with audio synths in p5.js. I think that this experience has helped my understand Hydra much more quickly. The visuals that I have been making have mostly been colorful psychedelic patterns and textures but I am interested in making audio reactive works, like I have made with Processing and p5.js. The most obvious use of Hydra, for me, has been for making visuals for electronic music. I can see many other ways of using Hydra, similar to how people use p5.js and Processing for making visual art. I really like the workflow using Hydra because I feel like it enables you to “get right into the action” instead of having to set up some basic things when using p5.js. I think it enables me to make much more “stream of consciousness” type of works where as p5.js will often lead me into obstacles that can disrupt my workflow. I was thinking about how Hydra could be used to make more recorded video works rather than live coding, because it is a lot simpler to use than After Effects or any other programs I would use to make simple visual effects and graphics. I am exited to continue working with Hydra and see that else I can make with it. 



Looking at the p5.js implementation of Conway’s Game of Life was interesting because it made me think about the aesthetics which are involved in the making of Artificial Life. The very scientific process of creating these artificial systems mimicking biological systems is then framed in an artistic way. For example, the artist/programmer decided to keep the edges of the grid clear to make a frame for the work. This is a very intentional artistic decision which has little to do with the biological systems which inspired it, or the math that makes it work. This decision was made just because the artist/programmer thought it looked cool. I would argue that decisions such as these, based purely in aesthetics, are where this program crosses the line and becomes art. Although it lies somewhere on the intersection between art and science, it becomes more artistic once this decision is made. Another example is when the artist/programmer decides to use the Conway’s Game of Life image as a texture for a 3D object. There is no functional reason for this decision besides the fact that it looks cool. 



Reading about Pound’s code generated comic artwork brought me back to thinking about Harold Cohen and his turtle robot. I think this reading cemented my feelings that the code art is completely made by these artists and is not made by the algorithms they use, as Harold Cohen thought. Even though randomness and algorithms play a huge part in how these works are created, I think that the artist is ultimately making the decision about which parts to keep, and which parts to change. This also reminded me of the program NoPaint, because even though the user is simply decided yes or no on each gesture, they are still using their own vision of what they would like their art to look like to make each decision.
