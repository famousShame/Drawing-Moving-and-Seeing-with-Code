Today I worked on using LOGO to make some repeating designs. At first, I messed around with the song creator. It was pretty cool but it was very limited as far as rhythm  and harmony. It was monophonic and you could only use square waves with no modulation of any kind. It seemed like it would be cool for kids but there weren’t any obvious possibilities on how to generate any music. More of just a little compositional tool.

I then began to experiment with the LOGO drawing tool where I quickly figured out how to make some cool designs with REPEAT and using very long FORWARD so they would wrap around the screen many times.

Situationism in is the the theory that behavior is determined by the environment rather than personal thought. In computing this relates to centralization or decentralization. In Turtles, Termites, and Traffic Jams : Explorations in Massively Parallel Microworlds, Mitchel Resnick goes over the history of computing and how it has become more and more decentralized over time. He mentions that college students of the 60’s thought of computers like a way for governments to keep tabs on its citizens. In some ways this has become true with the data collecting of big companies like Facebook and Google, whereas the future might have not looked so centralized in 1994 when this was written. I think that although computing became much more personalized and decentralized in the 80’s and 90’s, it has become increasingly more centralized in the last two decades. There are exponentially more computer users, but most of them do not realize how much of their data is being used to keep tabs on them and to sell them things.


I found it interesting the way that Resnick discussed cybernetics and computational ecologies. It reminded me of a lecture I saw at Processing Day where an artist/programmer computed algorithms to simulate concepts of Chaos Theory.


My algorithmic walk was not much of a success. I quickly became anxious about looking like I did not belong and returned home. It made me think about maybe doing another algorithmic walk about social anxiety and overcoming negative feelings.
